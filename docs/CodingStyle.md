**TLDR:**
This document defines the coding conventions and design principles for the `gfx-test` project:
* Modular design
* Data-driven design
* Self-documenting code
* Encapsulation

# Coding Conventions

This document outlines the agreed-upon coding conventions and design principles for the `gfx-test` project.

## Design Principles

- **Modular Design**: The codebase should be split into logical modules with clear responsibilities (e.g., `renderer`, `game_state`).
- **Data-Driven Design**: Logic (functions) should be separated from the data it operates on (structs). Data is read from files or variables, not hardcoded in the source code.
- **Encapsulation**: All logic should be encapsulated within functions or methods.

## Code Style

- **Descriptive Naming**: Functions, variables, and other items should have clear, descriptive names that make the code self-documenting.
- **Standard Formatting (`rustfmt`)**: All code will be formatted using the standard `rustfmt` tool to ensure a consistent style.
- **Linter Suggestions (`clippy`)**: Code should adhere to the recommendations of the `clippy` linter to follow idiomatic Rust practices.

## Documentation

- **High-Level Comments**: Public functions should have a high-level description of their purpose using documentation comments (`///`).

## Error Handling

- **Postponed Implementation**: For the initial development phase, explicit error-handling logic is not required. Instead, a comment (`// TODO: Add error handling`) should be placed where error handling will be needed later.

## Configuration

- **Constants**: Global configuration values and constants (e.g., screen dimensions) should be defined at the top of the `src/main.rs` file, or read from configuration files.

## Development Philosophy: The Pragmatic Programmer

We follow the principles outlined in "The Pragmatic Programmer" to guide our
development process:

- **Care About Your Craft**: Take pride in your work; don't tolerate "broken
  windows."
- **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)**: Every piece of knowledge should have a single, authoritative representation.
- **Orthogonality**: Design independent, self-contained components.
- **Test Ruthlessly**: Design for testability and test often.
- **Crash Early**: Fail fast and loudly when something goes wrong.
- **Know Your Tools**: Be fluent with your development environment.
- **Communicate Effectively**: Convey information clearly and concisely.
- **Good Enough Software**: Deliver "good enough" software that meets requirements, then iterate.

We also follow these principles for development:

- Build on what works, and make it better in iterations. This is a principle from ITIL.
- When writing new code, get it working with 80 % accuracy (or better). Then improve the code in each iteration until it is working 96 % (or better).
- If you move data out from the source code and into data files (or config files), the source code does not have to be recompiled after updating data.
- Use a versioning system (v.1.00), increase the version number when making a change (v1.01), and test the code changes.
