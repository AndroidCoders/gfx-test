# Development Workflow

**TLDR:**
* This document outlines the development workflow for the project.
* All new work is done on separate branches.
* Pull requests merge new changes into `main`.
* Pre-commit checks: `cargo check`, `cargo clippy`, `cargo test`

This document outlines the development workflow for the `gfx-test` project. Following
this workflow helps maintain a clean and consistent codebase.

## Document Structure

Each guiding document in this project starts with a "TLDR" (Too Long; Didn't Read)
section. This section provides a concise summary of the document's content,
allowing readers to quickly grasp the main points.

The TLDR section is formatted as a bold "TLDR:", followed by a descriptive
sentence, and then a bulleted list of key points.

Example: See top of this document.

## Branching Strategy

All new work should be done on a separate branch. Branch names should be descriptive, and follow this convention:

- **Features:** `feature/<short-description>` (e.g., `feature/add-player-character`)
- **Bugfixes:** `bugfix/<short-description>` (e.g., `bugfix/fix-rendering-glitch`)
- **Refactoring:** `refactor/<short-description>` (e.g., `refactor/move-drawing-logic`)
- **Documentation:** `docs/<short-description>` (e.g., `docs/update-readme`)

## Development Process

1. **Create a Branch:**
   Start by creating a new branch from the `main` branch with a descriptive name.

   ```bash
   git checkout -b <branch-name>
   ```

2. **Implement Changes:**
   Make your code changes, following the project's coding style and design
   principles.

3. **Run Checks:**
   Before committing your changes, ensure that the code is correct and follows
   the project's standards by running the following commands:

   ```bash
   cargo check  # Check for compilation errors
   cargo clippy # Check for common Rust mistakes
   cargo test   # Run all tests
   ```

4. **Update Documentation:**
   If your changes affect the project's Design, Requirements, or Structure,
   update the relevant guiding documents in the `docs/` directory.

5. **Commit Changes:**
   Commit your changes with a clear and descriptive commit message. Follow the
   [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification.

   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: Add new feature" -m "Detailed description of the new feature."
   ```

## Pull Requests

- **Push Your Branch:**
  Push your branch to the remote repository on GitHub.

  ```bash
  git push --set-upstream origin <branch-name>
  ```

- **Create a Pull Request:**
  You can create a pull request using the GitHub web interface or the GitHub CLI.

  - **Using the Web Interface:**
    Go to the project's GitHub page and create a new pull request from your branch
    to the `main` branch.

  - **Using the GitHub CLI:**
    You can use the `gh pr create` command to create a pull request from the command line.

    ```bash
    gh pr create --title "feat: Add new feature" --body "Detailed description of the new feature."
    ```

- **Code Review:**
  At least one other person should review your pull request before it is merged.
  The reviewer should check for correctness, style, and adherence to the
  project's standards.

## Merging

Once the pull request has been approved, it can be merged into the `main` branch.

- **Using the Web Interface:**
  Use the "Squash and merge" option on GitHub to keep the commit history clean.
  After merging, the feature branch should be deleted.

- **Using the GitHub CLI:**
  You can use the `gh pr merge` command to merge a pull request from the command line.
  It is recommended to use the `--squash` option to keep the commit history clean.

  ```bash
  gh pr merge --squash
  ```
  After merging, you can delete the branch both locally and on the remote.
  ```bash
  git branch -d <branch-name>
  git push origin --delete <branch-name>
  ```
